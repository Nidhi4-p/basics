c++
===

#include <iostream.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    cout << "Hello this is C++";
}

Comments in C++ Program
-----------------------
// This is single line comment

For multiple line comment, enclose the comment between /* and */

/*this is 
  a multiple line 
  comment */
  
  
Creating Classes in C++
------------------------
class Abc
{
    int i;           //data variable
    void display()         //Member Function
    { 
        cout << "Inside Member Function";
    }
}; // Class ends here

int main()
{
    Abc obj;  // Creatig Abc class's object
    obj.display();  //Calling member function using class object
}


Enum as Datatype in C++
-----------------------
Enumerated type declares a new type-name along with a sequence of values containing identifiers which has values 
starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 every time.

For Example:

enum day(mon, tues, wed, thurs, fri) d;

Here an enumeration of days is defined which is represented by the variable d. 
mon will hold value 0, tue will have 1 and so on. We can also explicitly 
assign values, like, enum day(mon, tue=7, wed);. Here, mon will be 0, tue will be assigned 7, so wed will get value 8.



Modifiers in C++
----------------
    long
    short
    signed
    unsigned

Some special types of variable
------------------------------


    Final - Once initialized, its value cant be changed.
    Static - These variables holds their value between function calls.



if-else statement in c++
------------------------
else if is used in cpp


else if(expression 2) 
{
    statement-block2;
}


 3 type of loops in C++ language
 -------------------------------
 unlike python,no need of colon after loop for "for" & "while"
    1.while loop
    2.for loop
    3.do-while loop
          do
          {
            // a couple of statements
          }
          while(condition);
          
        
        
 Storage Classes in C++
 ----------------------
 
 
    Global variables
    Local variables(They are defined and are available within a particular scope. They are also called Automatic variable)
    Register variables(This keyword is used to tell the compiler to make access to this variable as fast as possible. Variables are stored in registers to increase the access speed)
    Static variables(Static variables are the variables which are initialized & allocated storage only once at the beginning of program execution, no matter how many times they are used and called in the program.)
    Extern variables(This keyword is used to access variable in a file which is declared & defined in some other file)
    
    
 Basic Syntax for using Functions in C++
 ---------------------------------------
 
 return-type function-name(parameter1, parameter2, ...)
{
    // function-body
}

eg:

//declaring the function
int sum (int x, int y);

int main()
{
    int a = 10;
    int b = 20;
    int c = sum (a, b);    //calling the function
    cout << c;
}

//defining the function
int sum (int x, int y)
{
    return (x + y);
    
}


Calling a Function
------------------

    Call by Value
    Call by Reference

simple example for each:

Call by Value
-------------

void calc(int x);

int main()
{
    int x = 10;
    calc(x);
    printf("%d", x);
}

void calc(int x)
{
    x = x + 10 ;
}

output:
10


Call by Reference
-----------------

void calc(int *p);

int main()
{
    int x = 10;
    calc(&x);     // passing address of x as argument
    printf("%d", x);
}

void calc(int *p)
{
    *p = *p + 10;
}

output:
20
